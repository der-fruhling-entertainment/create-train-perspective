A major update to add configuration and port to 1.19.2.

[Changelog]
- Added a configuration system. https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/36
  - Allows enabling and disabling parts of the mod or the entire mod.
  - Also includes some advanced options:
    - "Leaning Magnitude" changes the intensity of the leaning effect.
    - "Rolling Magnitude" changes the intensity of the rolling effect.
    - All of these options are not something you should modify in a useful scenario, but may be fun regardless.
- Ported to 1.19.2. The new version is fully featured. https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/48
- **Fixed:** Jittering while standing on a train. https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/47
- **Fixed:** Some perspective stuff. https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/53
- **Technical:** Now publishing sources jar to Modrinth for whatever reason.

[Known Issues]
- A small workaround implemented in this update may cause some mods (including this one) to be ever so slightly jittery.
