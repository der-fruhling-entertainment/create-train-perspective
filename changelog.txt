Minor update to fix some issues.

- Fixed incorrect rolling when looking certain directions
- Now compatible with [do a barrel roll] and hopefully other camera roll kinds of mods.
- The third-person camera while seated on a train is now improved. https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/24

Known issues:
- The mod's leaning is a bit jittery. https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/22
  - This is probably more of a limitation of Minecraft itself. It might be fixable with a config option to emulate pitch, but that wouldn't make the player appear correctly to other players.
  - Update: it's most definitely possible to fix this up. 
- The easing back to normal posture after jumping off a train on a slope could use some work. https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/23
