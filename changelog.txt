Major update to fix major problems. The mod is in a pretty good state now.

- Players now look at their perceived down (e.g. the seat they're sitting in) rather than the real ground. https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/32
- Fixed jittery leaning. https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/22
- When targetting a block with the crosshair, the mod now makes some adjustments to target the block you should be looking at instead of the block the game thinks you're looking at. https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/35
  - This is probably incompatible with anti-cheat mods/plugins.
  - The feature is also still *ever so slightly* janky, but for most purposes it should be very usable.

Known issues:
- No known issues. Nice!
- If you find any bugs, be sure to report them in the Discord server or issue tracker, both listed below.
