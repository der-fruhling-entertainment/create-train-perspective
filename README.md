# Create Train Perspective Fixer

_More immersion!_

## What is this?

This mod constantly rotates the player's camera when the train they're riding in turns.

With the normal behavior, the player's camera stays in the same direction when the train turns, giving the appearance that the player themselves are turning. With this mod, the player no longer appears to turn.

## How do I build it?

### macOS/Linux
```shell
./gradlew runClient # run the client
./gradlew build # build the jar
```

### Windows
```powershell
./gradlew.bat runClient # run the client
./gradlew.bat build # build the jar
```
