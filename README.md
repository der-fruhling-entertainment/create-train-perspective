# Create Train Perspective Fixer

_More immersion!_

## What is this?

With the normal behavior, the player's camera stays in the same direction when the train turns, giving the appearance that the player themselves are turning. With this mod, the player no longer appears to turn.

**Notice:** This mod may cause motion sickness. Just like real trains, but blockier.

## How do I build it?

### macOS/Linux
```shell
./gradlew runClient # run the client
./gradlew build # build the jar
```

### Windows
```powershell
./gradlew.bat runClient # run the client
./gradlew.bat build # build the jar
```
