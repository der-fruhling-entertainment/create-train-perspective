Known issues:
- The mod's leaning is a bit jittery. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/22)
  - This is probably more of a limitation of Minecraft itself. It might be fixable with a config option to emulate pitch, but that wouldn't make the player appear correctly to other players.
- The easing back to normal posture after jumping off a train on a slope could use some work. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/23)
- The third-person camera is janky while on a train currently on a slope. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/24)
