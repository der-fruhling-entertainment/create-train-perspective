- Player camera now leans while their train is on a slope.
  - Also, camera now rolls when facing sideways on a slope.
  - (hopefully this feature doesn't break other mods)
- Player legs are now locked forward while seated on a train.
- Players standing on a train will now be affected the same way as players sitting.
  - This does not fix the Create mod issue where standing players may be ejected from the train if it is traveling at high speeds.
- Players riding taller trains now lean correctly.

Known issues:
- The mod's leaning is a bit jittery. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/22)
  - This is probably more of a limitation of Minecraft itself. It might be fixable with a config option to emulate pitch, but that wouldn't make the player appear correctly to other players.
- The easing back to normal posture after jumping off a train on a slope could use some work. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/23)
- The third-person camera is janky while on a train currently on a slope. [View issue.](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/24)
